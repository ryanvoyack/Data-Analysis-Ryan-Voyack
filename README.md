# Data-Analysis-Sophomore-Year
My first big data analysis project using R programming techniques acquired as a student at PSU, a final class project 

research question: Air Pollution's relative effect on Lung Cancer incidences in the United States. 
This project is statistical analysis on the effects of air pollution in regards to its relative influence on lung cancer in the United States using R. This project was submitted as the final project for my Stat 184 class here at the Pennsylvania State University. Stat 184, in its inaugural section during the Fall 2016 semester, taught students to use R for big data analysis - where we focused on code that worked to manipulate data sets, working to "tidy" them for visual representation, which was accomplished using graphing functions later taught in the class.
