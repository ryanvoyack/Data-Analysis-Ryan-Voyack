## Creating an interactive tic-tac-toe app that dynamically uses a question bank to serve as a quiz game

The research opportunity with the Department of Statistics at PSU this past summer (2018) that I was involved in works to create learning supplements for undergraduate statistics courses using R Shiny applications. I am highlighting interactive tic tac toe game that I originally coded for the research program's estimation and testing module. The apex of the codes capabilities is that the tic tac toe game itself could be used in other researchers' apps, where they only need to create their own question banks to quiz users with (of course, they need to create the question bank using the same format as my original bank). In total, this tic tac toe game structure that I have coded is being used in 4 of the apps in the research programs book of apps.

Currently, the Department is working on publishing these 4 apps in quesiton onto their university web page. Also, my tic tac toe app (the original) is published on my [personal Shinyapps account](https://ryanvoyack.shinyapps.io/tic-tac-toe) . I am very proud of this code, there were many challanges, and the end product couldn't have been accomplished had it not been for a great display of reactive programming in the [server logic](https://github.com/ryanvoyack/PSU-shiny-research/blob/master/tic-tac-toe/server.R) . All files for this game can be viewed [here](https://github.com/ryanvoyack/PSU-shiny-research/tree/master/tic-tac-toe) .

The project's first publication, using skills acquired after competing my first course in R: 


My first data-analysis project, using the skills I learned in Introduction to R at PSU, can be found [here](http://rpubs.com/ryanvoyack/305351) . This project was completed and submitted for the class's final project assignment during finals week, on December 9th, 2016. This project focused on the techniques learned in the "Introduction to R" class, rather than statistical methods themselves. These techniques included tidying data sets, graphing functions, and web scraping in order to achieve graphical analysis while also formatting documents and code to be (more easily) reproducable and readable. There is a [repository](https://github.com/ryanvoyack/Data-Analysis-Ryan-Voyack) dedicated to the documentation and progress of this project.

The app's perfection. The current publication is version 1.0, this was completed following a group project at PSU.


My first Shiny App, using the skills I learned in Stat: Special Topics at PSU, can be found [here](https://ryanvoyack.shinyapps.io/financialPlots/) . This app was perfected after the end of the class where this app had [originally](https://github.com/andywwwww/group3_project) been assigned as a final project, this class ended on December 11th, 2017. This project focused on using function writing and package building in order to create an interactive web app. The completion of this project for the class required an app and a package that contained any functions, since the conclusion of the class, I have built upon and perfected the idea. The final product is provided in a [repository](https://github.com/ryanvoyack/financialStatementPlot) that contains a package which includes the functions, their documentation and the Shiny App itself.
